			</h2>
			<p>Scoutomic is SERT's scouting application, which will be used at competitions to keep track of team information and help estimate the best alliance partners.</p>
			<h2>
				<a id="awesome-how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#awesome-how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Awesome! How does it work?
			</h2>
			<p>Scoutomic can be used in a variety of different ways, each with its own benefits.</p>
			<h4>
				<a id="digital" class="anchor" href="#digital" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Digital
			</h4>
			<p>By having every scout at the event use their own computer with Scoutomic installed, everyone is instantly updated with the latest scouting data, and can therefore make quick scouting decisions when it comes to the all-important alliance selection.</p>
			<h4>
				<a id="hybrid" class="anchor" href="#hybrid" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hybrid
			</h4>
			<p>When using a hybrid scouting system, some scouts use paper-and-pencil to record match information, then pass those papers off to a team that enters data into Scoutomic. This system – though not always as up-to-date as the digital system – is much cheaper and does not require all scouts to have laptops. In fact, some scouts may want to enter data using their own laptop, and, as all data is sent to a central database (<em>see below</em>), this would be a perfectly fine system, too.</p>
			<h2>
				<a id="cool-what-if-i-want-more-than-one-person-to-enter-data" class="anchor" href="#cool-what-if-i-want-more-than-one-person-to-enter-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cool! What if I want more than one person to enter data?
			</h2>
			<p>Fear not! All data is sent to an online database (which can be hosted by your own team, <em>see below</em>), and, if you're offline, the data will be automatically sent to the servers once you reconnect. This means that all your scouts are always up to date, and can see the latest information.</p>

				<a id="fantastic-how-do-i-get-started" class="anchor" href="#fantastic-how-do-i-get-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fantastic! How do I get started?
			</h2>
			<p>Simply download Scoutomic, start it up, and you'll be good to go!</p>
